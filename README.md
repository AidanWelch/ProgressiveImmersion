# ProgressiveImmersion
A browser extension that progressively immerses you in a language.

## Will not fix issues:
* Languages that do not seperate words with whitespace cannot work as origin/source languages.  To fix this would require knowledge of each language that I do not have.  You can fix it yourself, or if you don't have the technical ability but do have the knowledge of one such language you can contact me at the email on my Github profile.
